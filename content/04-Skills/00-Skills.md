# Skills

In order to perform tasks of non-trivial difficulty, characters must use their **skills**. These govern a wide variety of tasks, ranging from haggling to handling explosives.

All skills are ranked from a minimum of 1•0 to a maximum of 20•0. The initial rank for all skills is determined by the sum of two base stats; in practice, starting skills range from 1•1 (2 points, two stats of 1) to 5•5 (20 points, two stats of 10).

Every skill has 3 focuses, each representing a specific specialization within the purview of that skill. Focuses range from 0•0 to 10•0. The rank of a focus cannot exceed that of its base skill. The initial rank for every focus is 0•0.

Characters’ backgrounds provide a handful of progress points they can assign to a subset of skills. These can be distributed freely among the skill’s base rank and its focuses.
