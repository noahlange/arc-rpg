# Conditions

Over the course of gameplay, various temporary effects can help or hinder characters.

## Sleep

<!-- @todo: enumerate downsides/details of chemical stimulants.  -->

Every character requires sufficient sleep to remain functioning at their peak potential. Every stage of :sleep: beyond 4 reduces a character's :speed: by 1.

Chemical stimulants can be used to temporarily offset the effects of sleep deprivation, but have downsides of their own.

## Hunger

Every long phase is considered either active or sedentary. Every sedentary phase adds 1 point of hunger, every active phase adds 2. Every rank of :hunger: beyond 4 reduces :brawn: by 1.

- a snack reduces hunger by 1
- a light meal reduces hunger by 2
- a full meal reduces hunger by 4

## Toxicity

Using fast-acting med hypos, taking drugs, injecting stims and consuming various psychoactive substances can add flood your system with toxic byproducts. Every rank in :toxicity: reduces a character's maximum :health: by 1, andâ€”if already at full :health:, their current :health: as well.

Most basic medical facilities, as well as some of the more expensive private autodocs, have the necessary equipment to reduce blood toxicity, though particularly severe cases may require more than one treatment before they can be completely resolved.
