# Rank & Progress

Rank & Progress (RP) scores are used to handle numbers within a limited range while still enabling constant, incremental progression. Systems with scores that max out at smaller numbers (say, 20) tend to be more ergonomic than the full range of 1%-100%, opportunities for character advancement tend to be much less frequent, albeit with greater, more dramatic effect.

Every RP score is composed of two numbers, a rank and a progress. When written, these are joined with a dot (•)—and in the case of a progress of 0, the latter number may be omitted entirely.

An RP score’s rank serves as its effective, in-practice value. When an RP score is invoked during regular gameplay, the score is represented as its rank.

> An object with a Size (:size:) of 3•1 has a rank and therefore effective :size: of 3.

A score’s progress point value (often referred to simply as “progress” or “points”) tracks progression from one rank to another.

> Bob's Operate skill is 14•3. He fails a skill check and gains 1 progress point. His skill increases to 14•4.

An RP score’s minimum progress value is 0. The score’s maximum progress value is equal to its current rank.

> 3•0 represents the lowest amount of progress from rank 3 to rank 4.3•3 represents the maximum amount of progress from 3 to 4.

When an RP score is at its maximum progress value and gains another point, its rank increases by 1 and its progress resets to 0. If an RP score is at its minimum value and loses another point, its rank decreases by 1 and progress is set to the value of the new rank.

> An object, including several attached doohickeys, has a material cost of 3•0. Removing one doohickey with a cost of (0•1) from the object reduces the overall material cost from 3•0 to 2•2.

Determining ranks from significant numbers of progress points (e.g., 14) can prove tedious. The table in Appendix II lists the corresponding ranks for progress points ranging from 1 to 695.
