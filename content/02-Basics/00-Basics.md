# Basics

**Arc** has a small number of concepts players should be familiar with before starting, as well as a basic list of materials.

## Game Master

The Game Master (cf. "Dungeon Master" in D&D; from here on, "GM") serves as the players' point of contact with the fictional world their characters inhabit. In some tabletop role-playing games, the relationship between the players and GM is adversarial. Following in the spirit of the cyberpunk genre, the _setting_ should serve as the players' primary adversary.

The GM should instead take the role of an advocate—not taking overt actions to assist the players materially, but also not going out of their way to make the players' lives more difficult than would be otherwise. Borrowing the legal metaphor, the GM is there to serve as the players' defense lawyer—not the prosecutor, judge, or executioner.

That's not to suggest that the GM should fudge rolls—but when mistakes happen, give the players a break. The GM isn't there to kill them, the world is.

## Materials

### Pen & paper

Alongside a pen (or pencil) and character sheet, players should have access to scratch paper for tracking frequently-changing values — HP, Stamina, armor condition, &c.

### Dice

Both the gamemaster and each player of Arc should have access to at least one full set of polyhedral dice: :d4:, :d6:, :d8:, :d10:, :d12: and :d20:. When representing a the result of a roll (e.g., roll 2d8 for damage) standard dice notation is used. When representing a step (e.g., “:d12: vs. :ballistic:”, “roll :d20: vs. Small Guns”), the icon is used instead.

# Icon

A variety of icons are used throughout Arc. The shape of the icon indicates the type of thing being represented: scores and resources are surrounded by circles (e.g., :health:, :alloy:), hazards by triangles (:ballistic:, :thermal:) and item stats by cogs (:cost:, :size:). A comprehensive list of icons used in Arc, along with their meaning and usage, is presented in Appendix III.
