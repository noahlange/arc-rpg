# Programming

While the early twenty-first century’s optimistic technofuturists loudly proclaimed that programming languages were the next step in multilingual education, programming in practice has still remained a mostly niche field. And as automation gobbles up more and more entry-level positions, the bar for employable facility with programming and programming languages has risen significantly.

The basics remain: programming is the science (and art) of communicating with computers and forcing them to do your bidding. The average user takes advantage of commercial and open source software to interact with them. Programmers use languages to speak with computers directly.

Most languages in use in the first half of the twenty-first century remain in use today, and are still often lumped into one of two categories: low-level and high-level.

Low-level languages require a close understanding of the software and hardware underlying any given computer, but offer unparalleled power—and, more importantly, speed. When performance is at a premium, low-level languages remain the weapons of choice for experienced programmers.

High-level languages trade power for simplicity and convenience. They remain accessible to those without a detailed understanding of the inner workings of computers, but still offer many of the same capabilities as their lower-level counterparts.
