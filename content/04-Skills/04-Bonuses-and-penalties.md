Because beginning characters' chances of success are fairly low, finding ways to "stack the deck" in their favor can be nearly as important as the skill check itself. There are two ways that skills checks can be modified: the TN or the degree increment. Raising the TN will make _passing_ the check easier, but high-degree successes can still be difficult to obtain. Conversely, a lower degree increment will increase the magnitude of a success, but won't affect the odds of getting on in the first place.

Generally speaking, TNs are affected by circumstantial modifiers and experience, while degree increments are affected by tools and equipment.

> _Example_: Foobar deploys his bipod before shooting, reducing its Spread (and by extension, its degree interval) from 3 to 2. His roll of 6 is a success at +3ยบ.
>
> _Example_: Foobar (Guns 8) attempts to shoot something (Spread 3), but a circumstantial modifier increases the TN by 2. His roll of 6 is a success, but only at +2ยบ.
