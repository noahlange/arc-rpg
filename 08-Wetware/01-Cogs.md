# Cogs

Cogs are a generic term for brain–computer interfaces, referring to the first widely-available BCI technology, electrocorticography (or ECoG), in which a thin plate of electrodes is surgically implanted beneath the skull, between the cerebral cortex and dura mater. Used to monitor and stimulate brain activity, cogs are the fundamental prerequisite for thought-based computer interaction.

Most cog implants operate with an embedded wireless interface.

The highest performance and lowest latency cogs are exclusively wired. Because wired cogs require a permanent hole to be bored into the base of the user’s skull, they’re more costly (and dangerous) to acquire and less common than their wireless alternatives. Users of wired cogs must remain in a fixed position while plugged in, and typically rely on removable wireless adapters for everyday use.
