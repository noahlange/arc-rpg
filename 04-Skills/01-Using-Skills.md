# Using skills

Skills are Rank & Progress scores and follow the same rules as the rest of them. Progress points for skills are obtained by failing high-stress skill rolls. Every failed test grants +1 progress point.

When a character’s skill is tested, they can choose whether or not to apply a relevant focus. If so, the rank of the skill and its focus are summed. If not, the skill rank alone is used.

For normal conditions, that value is the so-called Target Number (TN) for the skill check. The TN is compared to the result of a d20 roll. Rolling at or below a skill check’s TN is a success—the character accomplishes what they set out to do. Rolling above the TN is a failure, and the character's attempt fails.

> Example: Foo shoots (Guns 16) at Bar, who attempts to dodge (Evade 12). Foo rolls a 4 and succeeds. Bar rolls 13 and fails. Foo hits Bar.

Favorable or unfavorable circumstances can reduce or increase the difficulty of skill checks by modifying its TN.

Because the maximum rank for any given skill is 20, characters at the absolute pinnacle of their abilities cannot fail under ordinary circumstances. Only particularly hazardous situations will prove a meaningful challenge for these characters.

> Example: Foobar (Operate 20) is flying a VTOL in a hurricane (taking a -5 modifier to Operate checks for airborne vehicles). Despite his virtually unparalleled skills in this field of expertise, he rolls a 1d20 = 16 vs. TN 15 and crashes.
