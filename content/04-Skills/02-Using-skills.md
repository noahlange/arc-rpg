# Using skills

Skills are Rank & Progress scores and follow the same rules as others.

When a character’s skill is tested—or **checked**—they can choose whether or not to apply a relevant focus. If so, the rank of the skill and its focus are summed. If not, the skill rank alone is used. That value (in addition to any circumstantial modifiers) is the so-called Target Number (TN) for the skill check. Upon rolling a :d20:, the result is compared to the TN. Rolling at or below the TN is a success; the character accomplishes what they set out to do. Rolling _above_ the TN is a failure, and the character's attempt does not succeed.

> Example: Foo shoots (Guns 16) at Bar, who attempts to dodge (Evade 12). Foo rolls a 4 and succeeds. Bar rolls 13 and fails. Foo hits Bar.

Favorable or unfavorable circumstances can reduce or increase the difficulty of skill checks by modifying its TN.

Because the maximum rank for any given skill is 20, characters at the absolute pinnacle of their abilities cannot fail under ordinary circumstances. Only particularly hazardous situations will prove a meaningful challenge for these characters.

> Example: Foobar (Operate 20) is flying a VTOL in a hurricane (taking a -5 modifier to Operate checks for airborne vehicles). Despite his virtually unparalleled skills in this field of expertise, he rolls a 1d20 = 16 vs. TN 15 and crashes.

## Focuses

Characters can specialize in particular aspects of skills, or **focuses**, to exchange flexibility for speed of progress. Each Focus is a standalone Rank & Progress score ranging from 0 to 10. Whenever the skill is checked and the focus can be logically applied, its rank can be used _in addition to_ the skill's rank.

> _Example_: The rank of Foo's Athletics skill is 5. The rank of its Endurance focus is 2; Strength is 2 and Flexibility is 0. Foo needs to run a long distance as fast as possible—he can augment his 5 Athletics with 2 Endurance for a total TN of 7—improving his odds of success from 25% to 35%.

Focuses acquire progress indepenently of their base skills, allowing for characters to specialize rapidly or generalize slowly.

> _Example_: Foo's player failed 6 Endurance-related Athletics checks in the last session. Over the course of the session, he could have chosen to increase his Athletics skill from 5•0 to 5•5—for a 0% increase in the odds of success for any given check. He could _also_ have used these progress points to increase his Endurance from 2•0 to 4•0 instead—improving his odds of success for future Endurance checks from 35% to 45%.

Focuses cannot exceed the value of their base skill, and cannot make the TN for any given skill check exceed 20.

## Skill progression

Per the aphorism, failure is the greatest teacher.

Progress points for skills and focuses are obtained by failing skill checks.

Every failed check grants 1 progress point to the base skill _or_, if relevant and invoked, focus.
