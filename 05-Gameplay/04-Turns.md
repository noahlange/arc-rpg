# Turns & Action Points

A combat encounter consists of any number of rounds, continuing until all combatants on one side surrender, retreat or are incapacitated. Each round consists of turns taken by the characters engaged in combat, and each turn consists of its character’s actions. Every action has a corresponding AP cost.

At the beginning of each round, characters consult their :speed: and receive a corresponding number of Action Points to spend.

## Rate of Fire

All weapons have a Rate of Fire (:rof:) stat suggesting the rough midpoint between its cyclic and practical rates of fire. For most weapons, this is a whole number—e.g., 5 or 6—indicating the maximum number of hits per AP spent attacking. For manually-operated weapons, it can also be a fraction—e.g., ⅓—indicating the AP required to make a single attack.

## Spread

All weapons have an integral Spread (:spread:) stat that reflects its controllability. Any attack made using the Guns skill has a success degree interval equal to its :spread:. The attack’s maximum degree of success is limited by its Rate of Fire (:rof:).

> _Example:_ Armed with a :ballistic: 3d6 / :spread: 4 / :rof: 3 rifle, Ivan Ivanovich succeeds on his Guns º4 check with a 16. He nets +4º on his target—16, 12, 8 and 4. The rifle’s relatively low :rof: prevents him from landing the fourth hit, but rolls for a total of (3×3=9)d6 damage.

> _Example:_ Ivan Ivanovich attacks twice with a :ballistic: 3d10 / :spread: 5 / :rof: ⅓ pump-action shotgun, spending 6 AP on his attack. He succeeds with +1º and nets only a single hit, for a total of 3d10 damage.

> _Example:_ Armed with a :ballistic: 2d4 / :spread: 3 / :rof: 8 submachine gun, Ivan Ivanovich succeeds on his Guns :d20:º3 check with +4º—for a total of (2×4=8)d4 damage.
