# Crafting

The maturation of additive manufacturing techniques in the first half of the 21st century was among the most significant developments in manufacturing since the introduction of CNC machines. Most early 3D manufacturing techniques relied on various types of polymers that proved unsuitable for high-intensity applications.

## Feed

At the end of the 21st century, a wide variety of polymer and metallic feedstock (feed, for short) can be used with even the most basic printer. Given the appropriate schematics, feedstock and time, everything from furniture to firearms can be now be produced in the privacy of one’s home.

Feeds form the building blocks of all fabricated objects.

### Type

There are four types of feeds, each corresponding to a single “genre” of raw material.

#### Polymer

#### Alloy

#### Chemical

#### Rare

"Rare" is a catch-all for difficult-to-source materials, ranging from radioactive isotopes to exotic minerals.

### Quality

Material feed can be acquired in three qualities—low-quality (bronze), standard (silver) and high-quality (gold). Low-quality feed is inexpensive and readily available. Standard-quality feed is more expensive, and high-quality feed is both more expensive and more difficult to acquire.

Complex and high-quality item schematics often list higher feed quality requirements. A nominally-functioning one-shot, Liberator-style pistol can be made with a small amount of :alloy:, but a gas-operated semi-automatic carbine made with such low-quality feed may be liable to exploding unexpectedly.

#### Substitutions

A printer will be able to fabricate an item using feed at or within one ‘step’ of the schematic’s indicated quality. Bronze and gold feed can be substituted with silver at both higher and lower quality levels. Silver can serve as a low-quality substitute only for gold, and bronze can serve as a high-quality substitute only for silver.

Substituting high-quality materials for lower-quality ones will grant improved reliability and increased value, but will be significantly more expensive to manufacture. Lower quality feed can be used instead of its higher-quality equivalents, but the resulting object will likely suffer from degraded performance characteristics and overall reliability.

#### Refinement

Large amounts of low-quality feed can be converted into smaller quantities of high-quality feedstock using a refiner. Cheap refiners and unskilled users will typically waste feed, producing smaller amounts of feedstock than a skilled user with a quality refiner.

## Schematics

Blueprints and schematics are distributed as STL files through a variety of legal and less-than-legal means. Schematics for all but the rarest printable products can be acquired by the sufficiently-determined pirate.

Most online schematic marketplaces issue them alongside one-time-only licenses with a variety of copy protection mechanisms in place. These mechanisms make copyright infringement harder for the average user, but rarely prove to be a major obstacle for a technically-skilled cracker.

## Scanning

Printing directly from schematics is relatively straightforward. Generating a schematic from an existing object is more difficult. Structured-light 3D scanners project light patterns onto an object and use the resulting geometric deformation to generate a digital model.

## Printing

3D printing—colloquially, ”printing”—is an umbrella term for a number of different additive manufacturing techniques. Most printers work by depositing thin layers of polymer or metallic feedstock (‘feed’) and fusing the result with a high-intensity electron beam.

The quality of manufacture is typically determined by the quality of the machine and its feedstock. More expensive machines are capable of more sophisticated manufacturing techniques and are able to take advantage of higher-quality feedstock to generate more reliable and robust products—these also require greater skill on the part of the user.

3D printers are commonly used in illicit firearms manufacturing; schematics for automatic firearms can be easily acquired on the black market, and many disassembled weapons can be cloned using a scanner and printer.

| Industrial   |      |                                                                               |
| Advanced     |      | High-precision manufacturing, requiring advanced materials and skilled users. |

An enthusiast may have a professional-grade machine, but few have the money or space for commercial or industrial machines. Some companies will rent out time with higher-quality machines to individuals on an hourly basis.

## Fabrication

All objects require a mix of feed quality, feed types or both, have base feed costs expressed as RP scores and a minimum crafting rank. “Tags” can be applied to fabricated objects to reduce material costs or improve its capabilities.

The material consumed (in progress points) is equal to the difference between the ranks of the player’s relevant feed store and the material cost (minimum 1).

### Tags

| Tag          | Description                                                                   |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-Quality | The use of high-quality materials improves reliability and value.             |
| On the Cheap | Material costs reduced by 1 point. Reliability and value reduced.             |
| Skilled      | A high crafting skill reduces material costs or increases quality at no cost. |
| Focused      | A relevant focus can improve performance at minimal cost.                     |

#### High-Quality

All feed requirements are shifted up by 1 quality level — e.g., 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 3, &c.

#### Skilled
