# Actions

## Aim

Characters can spend additional AP or :speed: to line up a shot before making an attack action in hopes of improving their odds of success. Each AP spent aiming adds +1 to the TN for the attack's skill roll.

Without aiming, most ranged attack rolls will take a penalty—this penalty is referred to a the weapon's **Base Accuracy**. Heavier and bulkier weapons have lower base accuracies than small and handier ones. The maximum bonus that can be gained from aiming the weapon is its **Max. Accuracy.**

Weapons with low Base Accuracy typically have higher Max, Accuracy and benefit the most from aimed attacks. Weapons with low or zero Base Accuracy penalties usually have lower potential for Max. Accuracy.

These properties are indicated by each weapon's :accuracy: and written as the two numbers by a slash—base accuracy, and max. accuracy.

## Attack

### Called Shots

### Overwatch

A character with unobstructed access to a sightline can declare an **Overwatch** action and commit any number of AP to a single attack reaction triggered once a target moves across the sightline.

Once the committed AP are exhausted, the Overwatch effect ends. An Overwatch action can be taken with a ranged or melee attack.

### Suppress

A character with a ranged weapon and unobstructed access to a sightline can declare a **Suppress** action and commit a number of AP (up to or including the weapon's :rof:) to a single attack roll, ending their turn. If the attack succeeds, any opponent who moves across the sightline is subject to an unopposed attack.

Each attack reduces the pool of committed AP by 1. Upon reaching 0, the Suppress effect ends.

A Suppress action can only be taken with a ranged weapon with 2+ :rof:.

## Move

Moving from one place to another requires a move action.

The AP cost for a move action depends on the direction of movement, speed of movement and quality of terrain.

Movement to a diagonally-adjacent square increases movement cost by 1 AP.

Movement over rough terrain increases movement cost by 1 AP.

### Slow

A slower, more methodical pace increases movement cost by 1, to 3 AP per 5’ square.

### Walk

The standard AP cost for movement to a directly-adjacent 5’ square is 2 AP.

### Run

An increased pace doubles distance to 10’ per 2 AP.

### Sprint

A sprinting pace doubles distance again, to 20’ per 2 AP.

### Lean

A Lean action allows you to shift into a directly adjacent square and perform actions from that square without moving into it. A leaning character does not trigger reactions from the **Suppress** or **Overwatch** attack actions.

### Reload

#### Magazines

#### Alternative feed systems

### Swap

In order to equip a stowed item or to stow a carried one, a character must perform a **Swap** action. The AP cost for a swap (:swap:) depends on several factors, but is primarily driven by weight and bulk. Smaller and lighter objects swap more quickly than larger and heavier ones.

In lieu of a Swap, an item can be discarded as a free action, but must be picked up again to be used.

An weapon fastened with a sling can be stowed out as a free action, but requires a normal Swap action to be raised again.

## Aid

To restore HP or remove :wound: dice, characters take an **Aid** action. The exact mechanism for each type of healing item varies, but generally has some combination of the following: a skill check TN, dice value, degree of success increment, swap time and AP duration for application. To apply an aid item:

1. The item must be equipped.
2. If the item requires time to be applied, the appropriate number of AP are spent. If more AP are required than are available, the character can spend :speed: or wait into their next turn.
3. Once the necessary AP have been acquired and spent, the item and its effects are applied.
   - If the item has no skill requirement:
     1. for HP items, the dice value is rolled; HP increases by this value.
     2. for wound items, the dice value is rolled; each point removes 1 Wound step.
   - If the item requires a check or offers a degree bonus, make a Medicine skill check.
     1. If the check is successful, HP is restored or Wound dice are removed as above.
     2. Each degree of success increases the magnitude of the effect by 1.
     3. If the check fails, the attempt has no beneficial effect.
     4. If the check is required, each degree of failure removes 1 point of HP or adds 1 Wound step.

### Example

> Dick has been injured, reduced to 5 HP and acquired :d12: and :d4: wounds. Dick draws a medhypo (2 AP) and applies it (1 AP). The medhypo has no skill requirement or degree of success bonus, and has a dice value of 2d4 = 7. Dick’s health increases to 12 HP, but retains both wounds.
>
> Jane (8 AP) arrives with a bloodfoam applicator and medkit. She draws the applicator and applies it (2 + 1 AP). The bloodfoam applicator has no skill requirement or degree of success bonus, and a dice value of 1d4 = 1. Dick's :d4: wound is removed, leaving a single :d12: wound. Jane has 5 AP remaining, but the medkit has an application time of 12 AP. She opts to spend the rest of her turn and 2 points of Speed to apply the medkit (5 + 2 AP = 6), with 5 AP remaining to finish her next turn.
>
> At the end of the round, Dick suffers 1d12 = 6 damage and is reduced to 6 HP.
>
> The next round begins; Dick opts to hold initiative until Jane has finished. Jane spends 5 AP to finish applying the medkit. She rolls Medicine 13º5 and succeeds with +3º. The medkit restores 1d12 = 7 + 3 = 10 HP and removes 1d4 = 1 + 3 = wound steps. Dick’s health is restored to 16; his :d12: wound is reduced to :d4:. He’s still bleeding, but is in much better shape than before. Jane, with 3 AP remaining, draws her weapon.
>
> Dick, having held his turn, takes out a bandage (2 AP) and attempts to apply it (4 AP). He fails his Medicine 5º5 test with -1º and somehow manages to make the wound worse, increasing it to :d6:.
>
> Jane rolls her eyes. Nice one, Dick.

## Reactions

### Overwatch

### Suppress

### Evade

Between the declaration of an attack and the attack roll, the target of any given attack may attempt to avoid damage by spending 1 AP—or, if no AP remain for the turn, 1 :speed:, and making an _Evade (React)_ check. If the defender succeeds, they take no damage. If they have an equal or higher degree of success than the attacker, the AP or :speed: spent is also refunded.

_Evade (React)_ can be applied against sneak attacks, incoming grenades and other sudden threats. An attempt to Evade a regular, anticipated attack relies on Evade (Dodge).

### Clear

Upon fumbling an attack roll with a firearm, the weapon malfunctions and must be cleared before it can be fired again. Clearing a jammed weapon requires a reload action.
