# Initiative

To determine the order of combat, each character checks AGI ร2 against :d20:ยบ5. Characters who succeed on the check take turns in descending order. Characters who fail the check take turns in ascending order.

> Example: A and B succeeded on their check, with a 6 and 5, respectively. A goes first, followed by B. Having failed their checks, D (3), C (4) and E (7) follow.

A success also allows a character to take :d10: for any actions or skills involving either of these stats during their first turn, instead of :d20:. A failure has no negative effects.

> Example: Francis (AGI 3, DEX 4) rolls vs. TN 7, failing with 8. Bacon (AGI 6, INT 6) rolls vs. TN 12.
