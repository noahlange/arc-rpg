# Drugs

Street drugs and easily-abused pharmaceutical drugs are readily available to those inclined to try them. Designer drugs, with a variety of effects, are popular among the wealthy elite, but require sophisticated fabrication equipment and access to a variety of restricted chemical precursors.

Many street drugs are derived from natural sources and cooked using relatively primitive manufacturing techniques. They tend to be more dangerous than designer drugs and are also frequently ‘cut’ using inactive substances with similar properties—color, consistency, water solubility, &c. Street drugs are often ‘laced’ with additional, often cheaper, mind-altering substances to mimic or enhance the effects of the primary drug.
