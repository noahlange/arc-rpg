# Success and failure

"Yes" or "no" is usually a sufficient answer to the question "did the skill check succeed?". It usually falls short when the _quality_ of a success or failure is relevant to the situation—most commonly, when characters make rolls in contest.

The **degree of success** or **failure** of any given skill check is the roll value divided by a **degree increment**, rounded up. By default, skill checks have a degree increment of 5.

> _Example:_ Gus rolls 9 versus Software 8, a failure. Dividing the roll value (9) by the degree increment (5) and rounding down yields a degree of failure of 1.

When relevant, degrees of failure and success are notated as `±xº`, where ± indicates a success or failure and "x" is the degree.

> _Example:_ Gus rolled Software -2º — a failure with a degree of 2.

A higher degree of success indicates a higher _quality_ of success. But since a high skill level is required in order for a high-value roll to succeed, only the truly skilled can obtain more than one or two degrees of success.

> _Example:_ Robin Hood (Archery 20) faces the Sheriff of Nottingham (Archery 16) and Friar Tuck (Archery 8). Friar Tuck succeeds with a 2 (+1º), striking one of the target's outermost rings. The Sheriff succeeds near the peak of his ability at 15, or +4º, and hits the bullseye. Robin Hood rolls 20 (+5º), splitting the Sheriff's arrow with great éclat.

Because the maximum value of a successful roll increases alongside a character’s skills, their maximum degree of success increases as well. However, the maximum roll for a failure increases as well—meaning that their failures, while less common, tend to be more severe.

While 5 is the standard degree increment for skill rolls, there are situations in which that may change. Skill rolls made using a firearm, for example, have a degree increment equal to the weapon’s :spread: score.

Other situations will reuse a roll's degree of success for a specific purpose—for automatic firearms, each degree of success on a skill check grants another hit. Some aid items will grant additional HP based on the degree of success of the user's Medicine check.

When written, skill checks with non-default degree increments are postfixed with the degree sign and then the value of the degree increment.

> _Example:_ Small Guns 5º3.  
> _Translation_: A "Small Guns" check with a target number of 5 and degree-of-success increment of 3.

## Automatic successes

When faced with a skill check with a TN of 20 or more—situations where characters _literally_ cannot fail—they can “take 1” for an automatic success at +1º.

This allows characters to bypass mundane tasks that present no meaningful challenge, either due to their skill or beneficial circumstances—e.g., picking a trivial lock in a familiar environment with no time limitations.

Taking 1 on a skill check benefiting from the degree of success is ill-advised, for attack/defense rolls and more.

> _Example:_ Jane (Medicine 20º5) applies military-grade bloodfoam (1d4+º) to a rapidly-expiring Dick (4 HP, 1 :d10: wound). She opts to take a 1 on her Medicine check and removes 1d4=2 step from his wound dice (to :d8:). At the end of the round, Dick suffers 1d8=6 damage and falls unconscious.
>
> Had Jane rolled 10 on her Medicine check (+2º), she would have been able to remove 4 steps—even with the same 1d4 roll of 2—clearing all of his wound dice in the process.
>
> Thanks for nothin’, Jane.
