Most implants enhancing physical performance require support structures throughout the body to help distribute skeletal stress.

### Musculoskeletal implants

Bones and muscles are popular targets for artificial augmentation and grant significant improvements in strength, speed, and durability. Carefully-designed bone and muscle implants can integrate subtly with the surrounding muscle and bone. These can be virtually undetectable, but are vastly more expensive (though no less effective) than wholesale removal and replacement of existing tissue.

### CNT bone reinforcement

The reinforcement of bones with a lattice-like structure composed of carbon nanotubes provides a stable foundation for muscular augmentation.

#### SMA fiber muscles

Wires composed of shape-memory alloys can be tightly bundled into structures resembling muscle fibers. Compared to ordinary muscles, artificial muscles composed of these fibers demonstrate significantly improved strength and endurance. Without skeletal reinforcement, they also have a tendency to fracture bone during extreme stress.

### Ballistic weave

Carbon nanotubes can be woven into bullet-resistant fabric that can be implanted underneath the skin.

### Spike weave

The materials required to minimize damage from low velocity, low cross section damage from piercing or slashing weapons aren’t the same as those used to defend against fragmentation or ballistic damage.

### Blast weave

Successful defense against shockwaves and overpressure effects relies on different mechanisms and different physical properties than either spike or ballistic weave. Blast weave also grants near-immunity to blunt-force attacks. However, the rarity of explosives on the open civilian market and limited utility of blast weave makes it relatively uncommon on the streets.

### Defensive weave

Most general-purpose defensive weaves provide decent protection against both ballistic, piercing and (to a lesser degree) shock damage—but are more costly and less effective than dedicated weaves with the same surface area.

### Hazard weave

Weaves composed of some more exotic compounds can provide decent protection against thermal, energy and toxic damage.

## Prostheses

### Digitigrade prosthesis

The normal human gait involves walking on the bottom surface of the feet. A digitigrade prosthesis replaces the leg and foot below the knee with one more closely resembling the lower limbs of a cat or dog, where the toes serve as the surface contact and the heel is suspended at or slightly behind the center of gravity. The reduced surface contact enables quieter movement.
