# Factions

## Tags

### Chain of Command

When making a social skill check against a target, take the higher of two reputations—the individual being tested or one of their superiors.

### Decentralized

This faction isn’t a single organization, but a loose confederation of multiple clans. While the faction as a whole may form agreements with others, it’ll be unconcerned with the PCs in all but the most exceptional circumstances—accordingly, the faction won’t have a primary reputation, but each sub-faction will.

### Sovereign

This faction holds de facto jurisdiction over law and policy. This includes most formal governments, but some of the largest megacorps act as states unto themselves, fielding their own private security forces and maintaining formal policies of conduct and discipline.

## Types

### Relations

### Allied

Some factions adopt mutual defense agreements between one another. The relatively high-risk, high-reward nature of such agreements requires significant coordination between the factions—from legal departments to boots-on-the-ground security.

Less common, though hardly unprecedented, are informal defense agreements between sub-factions of different, otherwise neutral groups.

On the other hand, subfactions operating within a single hierarchy almost always operate on mutual defense principles with others within their faction.

## Friendly

Relations between all but the most committed factions operate somewhere on the continuum from ententes (at the warmest) to non-aggression pacts (at the coolest).

### Neutral

“Don’t shoot first” is the essence of the gentlemen’s agreement that has largely kept the sprawl from tearing itself to pieces. While the policy is legally unenforceable, factions and arcs alike have been known to revoke legal and societal protections for repeated offenders.

### Unfriendly

Other factions have antagonistic relationships that fall short of all-out conflict. Cooperation between members is viewed with suspicion at best—and at worst, banned outright. These relationships often escalate into hostilities per the classic adage, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.”

### Hostile

Some factions, either due to history or ideological orientation, maintain a “shoot on sight” policy against one another. This is relatively rare among corps and the general populace, but significantly more common among gangs and clans engaged in turf wars.

## Player Relations

Over time, interactions between the player characters and the sprawl’s factions will begin to shape their relationship with the broader world. Acting against the interests or killing members of one faction is guaranteed to earn its ire, while gaining favor from its enemies.
