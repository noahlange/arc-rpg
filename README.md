# arc

A cyberpunky tabletop RPG with an emphasis on verisimilitude and non-emphasis on specific setting _stuff_. Because seriously, just get [Cities Without Number](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/449873/cities-without-number-free-version) and use that. It's objectively better than whatever I could spin up.

## Features

- [triangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) character progression
  - for continuous, granular advancement without percentile dice
- six stats, similar to d20
  - DEX, AGI, CON, INT, PER, CHA
- classless, skill-based
  - checks are d20, roll-under
  - degrees of success/failure
  - intuitive, granular skill progression
  - specialization vs. generalization
- other stuff
  - crafting and modifications
  - robust, verisimilar hacking mechanic
  - stupidly-detailed firearms mechanics
- custom icon font

## Icon font

There's an icon font (`arc.ttf`) living in the Unicode PUA between `u+f100` and `u+f200`, mostly derived from [game-icons](http://game-icons.net). I still need to do the appropriate attribution, &c.

| Range       | Icons                    |
| :---------- | ------------------------ |
| f100 - f107 | dice                     |
| f110 - f115 | damage types             |
| f120 - f122 | character stats          |
| f123 - f134 | resource + status tracks |
| f150 - f160 | item stats               |
