# Ranks

All characters begin with a basic level of proficiency in each skill, as determined by the sum of its relevant stats. Each point in the relevant attributes corresponds to a single progress point in the skill. Determine the skill’s initial rank by summing the stats. Consult Appendix 2 (Rank & Progress) for additional information.

> _Example:_ Character Z has a 5 in DEX and a 7 in AGI. His base Operate skill has 12 progress points, for an initial RP score of 4⋅1.

## Ad hoc skills

When testing a task that can’t be easily fit under the purview of an existing Skill, the GM can call for an ad hoc skill check. Ad hoc skills cannot be improved using progress points, but behave otherwise like ordinary skill checks. In the absence of stat increases, an ad-hoc skill’s rank is fixed and cannot increase over time.

The rank of an ad-hoc skill is calculated the same way as an ordinary skill’s base rank, by summing two relevant (as agreed upon by the player and GM) stats.
