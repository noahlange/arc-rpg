Medhypos are cocktails of fast-acting chemicals and medicinal compounds designed to preserve functional activity as long as possible until medical attention can be found.

### Improvised

A medhypo produced at some makeshift lab in the Sprawl, likely with questionable quality control and sanitation standards. The precise source and nature of the solution within might be better left unknown. Injected into muscle near wound.

### Standard

### Industrial

A medhypo intended for treating victims of lab or industrial accidents—biohazard or toxic substance exposure and chemical, electrical or thermal burns.

### Military

A military-grade medhypo designed to stabilize the victim of a gunshot, shrapnel, knife or other deep tissue wound. Inject into nearby muscle, follow-up with surgery and blood detox in a licensed medical facility.

## Bloodfoam

| Skill Check | None, _+Medicineº (Stims)_ |

Bloodfoam is a liquid substance used to stop bleeding without permanently damaging nerves or tissue.

### Improvised

Disposable, single-use applicator of consumer-grade bloodfoam, mixed with some combination of toothpaste, shaving cream and/or silicone from a caulking gun. Probably has at least one active ingredient. Apply directly to wound.

### Standard

Disposable, single-use applicator of consumer-grade bloodfoam, purchased at a nearby pharmacy. Apply directly to wound.

### Industrial

Disposable, single-use applicator of expensive, high-quality bloodfoam with additional chemical compounds to stimulate the body’s natural blood-clotting processes. Likely procured from an industrial facility or laboratory. Apply directly to wound.

### Military

Disposable, single-use applicator of unusually concentrated bloodfoam. Apply directly to wound, immediately follow-up with one or more blood detox sessions in a licensed medical facility.

## Medkits

A standard medical aid kit with bandages, rubbing alcohol, topical ointments and a simple tourniquet. Medkits take significantly more time and skill to apply than a basic medhypo, but cost much less and share none of the short-term risks associated with injectables.

### Improvised

A commercial first-aid kit, probably from a corner store pharmacy. The plastic case is cracked and some of its contents appear to be substitutes for the original components.

### Standard

### Military

A specialized medkit for providing first aid to combat casualties. Includes a tourniquet, heavy bandages, a cocktail of blood coagulants and painkillers, as well as a small toolkit for removing bullets and shrapnel.

### Industrial
