### Pistols

Over the course of the twentieth century, self-loading pistols became the default choice for self-defense firearms among police forces and civilians alike. While law enforcement usage in the United States lagged for several decades behind civilian adoption (largely due to claims of inferior ballistic performance), the advantages offered by detachable, double-stack magazines made their eventual replacement of the traditional revolver inevitable.

### Machine pistols

Fully-automatic pistols—colloquially referred to as machine pistols—are intimidating but usually fall under the category of “worst of both worlds” when compared to either semi-automatic pistols or small submachine guns. Despite their increased weight and bulk, most machine pistols (even those with detachable stocks) are effectively uncontrollable under automatic fire. This is due in large part to their typical rates of fire, which often meet or exceed those of conventional submachine guns. The use of some PDWs like the Škorpion vz.61 and other hybrid submachine gun/machine pistols may also benefit from investment in this focus.

### Revolvers

Despite the revolver’s mechanical simplicity and innate reliability, a limited capacity, rate of fire and lengthy reload process had doomed it to obsolescence by the end of the twentieth century. The only remaining—and largely unchallenged—advantage of the revolver is its ability to fire rounds too powerful for simple blowback or recoil-operated handguns. These can range from high-powered 'magnum' pistol rounds to small-caliber shotgun shells.

## Rifles

### Submachine guns

### Personal defense weapons

### Pistol-caliber carbines

Pistol-caliber carbines are semi-automatic rifles chambered for ammunition typically developed (and often preferred) for handguns. For PCCs firing specialty ammo, this may end up overlapping with the PDW. Unlike many other firearms, PCCs are legal for civilians to own and operate.

### Combat rifles

Select-fire carbines and rifles firing intermediate or full-power ammunition fall under the Combat rifles component of the Rifles focus. The term “intermediate” technically refers to anything between a pistol round and a full-power rifle round—in practice, these are rounds that cannot be fired from a handgun, but can be fired controllably from the shoulder in full-auto. More powerful ‘full-power’ rifle rounds are intended for semi-automatic fire from the shoulder and full-auto only from a bipod or other mounted position. Semi-automatic derivatives of assault rifles and battle rifles are often available on the civilian market. Some lighter, magazine-fed machine guns—usually (but not always) derived from existing assault rifle designs—may benefit from this component of the Rifles focus.

## Shotguns

Shotguns are longarms designed to fire high-caliber shells containing arbitrary payloads—typically shot, slugs, or flechettes. While larger, heavier and less maneuverable than handguns and personal-defense weapons, they’re significantly more powerful and versatile within their effective range (<25m).

The majority of contemporary shotgun designs are either pump-action or self-loading. Break-action shotguns—in double-barreled, over-under or side-by-side configurations—are now under the purview of historians and trap shooters, and the few alternative operating mechanisms (lever-action, revolving) have seen little success. Crude slam-fire shotguns have, surprisingly, experienced something of a renaissance—a few companies market these so-called “guerrilla guns” on the home-defense and prepper markets.

## Machine Guns

### Squad automatic weapon

### Light machine gun

### General-purpose machine gun

### Heavy machine gun

## Marksman rifles

The distinction between sniper rifles and anti-materiel rifles comes down to usage: firearms designed to be used against enemy personnel are sniper rifles, and those designed to be used against lightly-armored vehicles and equipment are anti-materiel rifles.

### Designated marksman rifles

The old Soviet Union’s issue of semi-automatic precision rifles at the squad level was a natural outgrowth of Soviet military doctrine in World War II. The influence of the Anglo-American tradition of “rifleman as marksman” and adoption of full-powered service rifles throughout NATO in the first decade of the Cold War made squad-level marksman rifles redundant. The Soviet emphasis on high volume of fire at close range made their adoption a necessity in shoring up a key tactical weakness—namely, limited effectiveness at long range. The adoption of light, high-velocity intermediate rounds during the Cold War eventually allowed the Soviet model to prevail. As the performance limitations of such ammunition grew readily apparent in the first decades of the 21st century, the adoption of squad-level, full-power semi-automatic rifles alongside general issue select-fire service rifles grew increasingly common in the West. Most Western designated marksman rifles (DMRs) are scaled-up derivatives of standard-issue assault rifles, and so will often benefit from the Rifles focus of the Small Guns skill.

### Sniper rifle

Sniper rifles are accurate, long-range, powerful rifles intended for use against high-value targets and psychological effect against enemy personnel. Sniper rifles fire a range of ammunition, ranging from full-power rifle cartridges (e.g., 7.62×51mm NATO) to high-power (.30-06) and ‘magnum’ (e.g., .338 Lapua Magnum) rifle rounds. Bolt-action sniper rifles are still relatively common; the innate simplicity of operating mechanism and low number of required parts lend themselves to the time-consuming process of high-precision machining. The benefits of self-loading operating mechanisms—namely, rate of fire—are mostly wasted on weapons intended for pinpoint accuracy at extreme range.

#### Anti-materiel rifle

As the name suggests, anti-materiel rifles are used to target and destroy enemy materiel—military equipment and structures, including generators, transmitters and unarmored vehicles. While not designed for use against human targets, the massive cartridges fired by anti-materiel rifles are undeniably effective.

Because targets are typically stationary or, at the very least, larger than your average enemy personnel, accuracy remains at less of a premium than range and destructive power. And unlike soft targets, lightly-armored equipment may require more than one shot to permanently disable. Semi-automatic anti-materiel rifles, with less stringent accuracy requirements, are more common than sniper rifles intended purely for an anti-personnel role.

### Clips vs. Magazines

In a world where guns are cars and bullets are gasoline, a clip is a gas can and a magazine is a gas tank. See, that wasn’t so hard!

## Feed Systems

Most firearms are fed with detachable box magazines. The number of rounds carried in a single box magazine varies based on the type of weapon and caliber of ammunition. Magazines for sniper rifles and single-stack pistols may have as few as five rounds, while casket and drum magazines for automatic weapons can run from 50 to 100. While the specifics may vary based on the weapon’s manual of arms, the process of reloading a box-fed weapon is simple and well-established. Once the user wishes to replace a magazine—either after having exhausted the magazine’s ammunition supply or as a matter of preparation, they depress a magazine release button. Magazines for some weapons will fall free upon release, but others must be manually detached. In either case, the discarded magazine is replaced with a loaded one. If a live round was in the chamber before the weapon was unloaded, the user can begin firing immediately. If not, the user must manually chamber an initial round using the charging handle.

#### Alternative feed systems

Machine guns intended for sustained automatic fire are fed using belts of ammunition stored in metal containers carrying 100 rounds or more. The AP cost for reloading a belt-fed weapon is much higher than the AP cost for reloading a box-fed one, but the reload process is otherwise identical. Revolving, pump-action and break-action (e.g., double-barrel shotguns) weapons are loaded one round at a time. These weapons have a significantly lower  than comparable magazine-fed weapons (often only 1 or 2 AP). However (depending on the weapon’s magazine capacity), the AP cost for reloading from empty to a full combat load is often higher.

## Modifications

Equipment can be modified to accentuate its strengths or compensate for its weaknesses. Modifications adjust the stats of the items to which they’re attached by adding or removing progress points from the stat’s RP score.

### Barrels

Most barrel modifications have a specific type—only one modification of any given type can be applied. In order for another modification of the same type to be added, the first must be removed.

#### Profile

The composition and thickness of a firearm’s barrel changes its performance and handling characteristics.

##### Heavy

Extended fire rapidly increases the temperature of a barrel, eventually causing it to warp and deform. Given two barrels of the same length, a heavier-profile barrel can be fired longer without negatively affecting accuracy or reliability. By dint of its additional mass, a heavy barrel also helps reduce recoil.

##### Light

A light barrel offers incremental improvements to mobility without significantly reducing the weapon’s suitability for automatic fire.

##### Pencil

An especially thin barrel, while compromising a weapon’s suitability for automatic or extended durations of fire and reducing its overall service life, can greatly improve a weapon’s handling characteristics and single-shot accuracy.

#### Length

The length of a barrel also changes its performance and handling characteristics. A short barrel reduces overall weight and grants mobility advantages in close quarters. For more powerful cartridges, short barrels can significantly reduce muzzle energy, degrading both accuracy at longer range as well as terminal performance. Long barrels offer the converse advantages and disadvantages—most weapons will see improved accuracy and range, but will also suffer from reductions in handling characteristics and overall utility in close quarters.

#### Misc

##### Free-floating

A “free-floating” barrel is mounted directly onto the receiver without secondary attachment points to any other part of the weapon. Even the slightest amount of additional pressure placed onto the barrel can have a compounding effect on accuracy, particularly at longer ranges. A free-floating barrel therefore eliminates the effects of accumulated heat and other physical stress that might be applied to its fore-end.

#### Compensator

A compensator (or muzzle brake) redirects recoil forces to improve stability and reduce spread.

#### Muzzle booster

A muzzle booster directs additional gas back into the weapon’s operating system to increase its cyclic rate, at the cost of reliability and a slight increase in recoil.

#### Shotgun

While uncommon due to their bulkiness and arguably overspecialized nature, shotguns have appeared in underbarrel configurations. Some are adaptations of existing weapons (notably the KAC Masterkey, in essence a stockless, gripless, aggressively-truncated Remington M870) while others are novel designs (such as the M26 MASS, with a detachable magazine and straight-pull bolt action mechanism). An underbarrel shotgun uses the stats of any standalone shotgun with 3•0 :size:, 1 :swap:, a truncated magazine and shorter range.

## Ammo

Many varieties of ammunition can be manufactured using a printer and small amounts of chemical and alloy feed. Particularly high-pressure ammunition and those with more exotic properties (incendiary, explosive, &c.) will usually require higher-quality equipment and feed. Firing ammunition manufactured with low-quality alloy or chemical feed increases the chance of misfires and reduces a weapon’s reliability faster.

## Ammo Class

The relative power of different cartridges is characterized with an “ammo class” ranging from 1 to 10. Roughly corresponding to muzzle energy, a bullet fired from a cartridge of ammo class 1 is typically light, slow-moving or both. Rounds from an AC 10 cartridge are large, powerful and/or have high muzzle velocities. There are, of course, tradeoffs—the recoil from and size of a weapon chambered for an AC 10 cartridge is unmanageable for someone attempting to fire from the shoulder. Because of the loose correspondence to projectile size, magazine capacities for low-AC rounds are typically superior to high-AC alternatives.

Rounds intended for handguns (pistols and revolvers) and personal defense weapons (including submachine guns and machine pistols), as well as the classic “plinking” cartridges, span ACs 1-3. Some of the most common contemporary cartridges in this range include 9×19mm Parabellum, .357 Magnum and .22 LR.

Intermediate cartridges, named for their size relative to pistol rounds and full-power rifle rounds, range from ACs 4-6. These include most cartridges fired by carbines, assault rifles, squad automatic weapons and light machine guns. The most common of these are 5.56×45mm NATO and the Soviet 7.62×39mm and 5.45×39mm rounds.

The full-power rounds favored during the first half of the twentieth century (and increasingly, the twenty-first) range from ACs 7-9. The lower of these represent the upper limit of rounds that can be reasonably fired from the shoulder. Examples range from rifle rounds (e.g., 7.62×51mm NATO) to classic rifle cartridges (.30-06 Springfield), and magnum-style rifle cartridges for large game and long ranges (.338 Lapua Magnum).

The cartridges fired by heavy machine guns and anti-materiél rifles (.50 BMG in the West, and under the Soviet sphere of influence, 12.7×108mm) have an AC of 10. These weapons usually require a bipod or tripod mount, or if fired from the shoulder, are done so exclusively from a prone position.

### Using ammo classes

A weapon’s AC is no different than any of its other RP scores; attachments or modifications can add or remove progress points to increase or decrease damage output. The mapping from AC to dice roll is a fuzzy one
