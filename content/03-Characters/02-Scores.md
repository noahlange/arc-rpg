# Scores

## Health

A character’s Health determines how much damage a character can sustain during combat before being incapacitated or mortally wounded. Every character has a base Health of 10. Each point of CON adds one rank to Health, from a minimum of 11 to a maximum of 20.

## Speed

A character’s Speed determines the number of Action Points a character can use during each round of combat. Every character has a base :speed: of 5⋅0. Every rank of AGI adds two progress points to Speed, to a maximum of 7⋅7. Each point of :speed: gained or lost also changes the number of available AP in each combat turn by 1.

Ranks of :speed: can be spent during combat to perform an Evade action.

Each stage of sleep deprivation reduces maximum :speed: by 1 rank.

Stimulants and other drugs can temporarily increase :speed:.

## Brawn

A character’s Brawn determines the number of items they’re able to carry. Every character has a base :brawn: of 5⋅0; every rank of CON adds one rank to :brawn:, from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 15. Each stage of food deprivation reduces maximum :brawn: by 1.

Every item carried by a character adds 1 point per Size rank to a character’s Load (:load:). If a character’s :load: exceeds their :brawn:, they’re encumbered and suffer penalties. Every rank of :load: beyond a character’s :brawn: reduces :speed: (and as a result, available AP) by 1.

> Nancy (CON 4, Brawn 4⋅0) is carrying a big honking gun (6⋅2), four magazines of 5.56 ammunition (4⋅0), a pair of medkits (2⋅0). She’s also wearing a mostly-inconspicuous ballistic vest (3⋅0). Nancy’s total load is 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 15 progress points, or 5⋅0. Since her maximum load is 4, her :speed: is reduced by 1.

## Damage Threshold

The sum of a character’s armor steps is referred to as their Damage Threshold, or DT. Any damage that meets or fails to exceed the DT is absorbed entirely. Damage that does exceed DT has the potential to damage the armor and degrade a character’s DT against future damage.

## Cash

A character’s Cash (:cash:) represents their financial resources. Instead of an absolute value, :cash: indicates a character’s purchasing power. Purchases have a “rank” cost corresponding to their relative value, reflecting a minimum :cash: necessary to purchase without jeopardizing the purchaser’s financial situation. Expensive purchases have a higher rank than cheaper ones. Any item with a cost rank at or below a character’s :cash: can be purchased without modifying its rank or its progress. Purchasing an item above that rank reduces :cash: progress by the value of the rank discrepancy.

> Example: Foobar (:cash: 4⋅2) attempts to purchase a jet rig (:cost: 6). With a -2 difference in rank, he loses 2 progress points and his :cash: falls to 4⋅0. Conversely, when goods and services are sold or provided, :cash: receives progress points equal to the value of the rank discrepancy. Example: the agreed-upon value of the stolen goods is 8. With a rank difference of +4, Foobar gains 4 progress points and his :cash: increases to 4⋅4.

> Example: Foobar (:cash: 4⋅4) wants to sell some spare ammunition valued at 2⋅0. Because the :cost: of the ammunition is minimal relative to his overall :cash:, it remains unchanged.

### Expenses

Ongoing expenses—bills, credit payments—are treated as a single monthly purchase. If a character’s expenses remain below their Cash rank, they have no effect on the character’s financial outlook. Every point of expenses exceeding Cash reduces it by one progress point each month.

### Loans and leases

Goods beyond the average individual’s purchasing power (vehicles, expensive devices and cybernetic augmentations) can often be financed—effectively, purchased in piecemeal installments. The value of the purchase is evenly divided into a number of smaller, regularly-occurring expenses.

> Example: a car has a cash value of 24⋅0. A buyer with cash 4 opts to finance the car across four years (24 - 4 / 4 = 5). The owner’s debt increases to 5⋅0 per month, causing them to lose 1 progress point of cash each month.

#### Reposession

Failure to pay a loan for a vehicle or cybernetic augmentation may result in its reacqusition.

## Cred

Where Cash is the currency of goods and services, credibility (or Cred) is the currency of relationships and power. Unlike Cash—which is a single, unspecialized score—players can have any number of Creds, each associated with a specific faction or location. All Creds have a primary score—some may have an arbitrary number of focuses.

### Improving Cred

On top of granting monetary rewards, completing jobs on behalf of other characters and organizations improves your Cred.

### Losing Cred

Jobs that negatively effect other characters or organizations can penalize your Cred. Being caught robbing one organization on behalf of another may improve your reputation with one, but will naturally incur a penalty with the other.
