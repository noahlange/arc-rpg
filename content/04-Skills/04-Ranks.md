# Ranks

All characters begin with a basic level of proficiency in each skill, as determined by the sum of its relevant stats (or a single stat, twice). Each point in the relevant stats corresponds to a single progress point in the skill.

Determine the skill’s initial rank by summing the stats. Consult [@TODO LINK] for additional information.

> _Example:_ Character Z has a 5 in DEX and a 7 in AGI. His base Operate skill has 12 progress points, for an initial RP score of 4•1.

## Ad hoc skills

When facing a specific task that can’t be easily categorized under the purview of an existing Skill, the GM can call for an ad hoc skill check. The TN for an ad-hoc skill check is the sum of the two relevant stats.

> _Example_: Character Z (DEX 5, AGI 7) is forced to make an ad hoc check using DEX + AGI. The TN for this check is 12.

Ad hoc skills cannot be improved using progress points, but behave otherwise like ordinary skill checks.
