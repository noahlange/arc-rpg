# Icons

Only some of this information is strictly relevant to the text — "alias" and "unicode," obviously, are not something that would end up in the final product.

The former is the key and the latter the value in the hash of icons that'd be interpolated using [markdown-it-emoji](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-emoji) (or something like it).
