# Stats

All characters have primary stats that describe their innate physical and mental characteristics.

- **Dexterity** (DEX) measures a character’s precision and accuracy. It serves as the primary stat for all Combat skills, and appears in ad-hoc skill checks requiring hand-eye coordination. Certain equipment and implants may require a minimum DEX score.
- **Agility** (AGI) measures a character’s speed and grace. The primary stat for all Finesse skills, AGI also determines the number of Action Points (AP) available to a character during each combat round—along with
- **Constitution** (CON) measures a character’s strength, durability and raw physical power. CON is the primary stat for Fitness skills and determines both a character’s Health (:health:) and maximum carry weight, or Brawn (:brawn:)
- **Intelligence** (INT) measures problem-solving and raw cognitive ability. Tech skills rely on INT.
- **Perception** (PER) measures awareness and attention to detail.
- **Charisma** (CHA) measures a character’s presence and personal magnetism.

Attributes range from 1 (minimal ability) to 10 (exceptional ability). For the purposes of tracking bonuses and penalties, Stats are treated as bare Ranks with a Progress of 0.

These attributes are effectively fixed. Experimental gene therapies have demonstrated some efficacy in permanently improving baseline capabilities, but in absence of that or other permanent medical treatments, stats do not increase as characters grow older and more experienced.

Special equipment, cybernetic implants or pharmaceutical intervention can increase the effective value of a stat, but the underlying stat doesn’t change—upon removing a stat-boosting implant, the stat will return to its initial value. Likewise, the stat-draining side effects of stims and chems will disappear as the drugs wear off.
