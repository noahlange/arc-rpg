## Combat

### Small Guns

The Small Guns (DEX×2) skill measures a character’s aptitude with conventional small arms—handguns, rifles and shotguns.

#### Handguns

The Handguns focus is most important for characters intending to specialize in close-quarters use of pistols and revolvers.

#### Rifles

#### Shotguns

### Big Guns

The Big Guns skill tracks a character’s proficiency with bulky weapons designed to high-power ammunition.

#### Machine Guns

#### Target rifles

#### Launchers

### Melee

Melee The Melee skill (DEX+AGI) measures a character’s capabilities in hand-to-hand combat. And while knives and shock batons are rarely the best option, sometimes they’re the only option.

#### Blades

Weapons that inflict piercing and slashing damage—knives, machetes, axes, ice picks, beer bottles—can take advantage of the _Blades_ focus. These tend to be lighter than bludgeoning weapons.

#### Bludgeons

Weapons—purpose-built and improvised—that inflict blunt-force trauma can take advantage of the _Bludgeons_ focus. Bludgeons range from clubs to stun batons to broken-off pieces of rebar. These weapons typically require more strength to use effectively than blades.

#### Brawls

Unarmed combat—including everything from fists to teeth to formal martial arts—falls under the purview of the _Brawls_ focus.

## Finesse

### Evade

#### Dodge

Moving quickly and in a manner to make targeting difficult for would-be attackers.

#### React

The ability to swiftly respond to dangerous circumstances can mean the difference between life and the recycler. The React focus can be used in response to sneak attacks, incoming grenades and other sudden dangers.

### Operate

#### Wheels

Everything from tanks to cars to motorcycles. The density of the sprawl and availability of transportation makes motorized vehicles primarily a luxury enjoyed by the wealthy and the wastelanders.

Some—extremely expensive—convertible vehicles have limited VTOL capabilities, at which times they take advantage of the Flyers specialization instead.

#### Flyers

##### VTs

Flyers capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) maneuvers are colloquially referred to as VTs (or ‘vee-tees’). Most VTs are used for short-range personnel and cargo transport. Paramilitary and corp-sec forces take advantage of their ability to hover, strafe and maneuver precisely, wielding them as makeshift close air support in urban settings.

##### Jets

Jet-powered aircraft are used for heavy transport—both passenger and cargo—and little else.

##### Drones

Drones are automated or remotely-operated flying vehicles. Most commercial cargo transport is performed by drones. Some drones are designed with radar and visual profiles similar to piloted aircraft in order to bait and eliminate attackers in older, manually-operated fighters. Kamikaze drones with an explosive payload are used frequently to target enemy personnel, but usually aren’t heavily armored enough to withstand AA fire from a regular military force.

#### Walkers

Automated mechs are typically “good enough” for most use-cases, so the use of exos and mechs (operated remotely or manually) is relegated largely to industrial and military settings.

### Stealth

#### Sneak

#### Conceal

#### Track

## Fitness

### Fortitude

#### Carouse

The Carouse focus reflects an individual’s ability to handle booze and drugs.

#### Endure

Remaining conscious and functional in the face of pain or other physical pressure.

#### Resist

???

### Athletics

#### Strength

#### Endurance

#### Flexibility

### Willpower

#### Morale

#### Resolve

#### Grit

Staying focused and the ability to maintain concentration in the face of distraction.

## Tech

### Software

### Hardware

#### Fabricate

#### Repair

#### Design

### Wetware

Wetware is a common slang term referring to cybernetic devices and advanced prosthetics—or, more generally, any hardware with a direct interface to an individual’s flesh and blood.

#### Devices

The creation and modification of cybernetic devices is governed by the Devices focus.

#### Security

The exploitation of and defense against security vulnerabilities in cybernetics falls within the purview of Security.

## Survival

### Awareness

#### Intuition

Most people aren’t going to be up-front about things. The ability to gauge their nature and intentions is a valuable tool.

#### Scan

### Investigate

#### Inquire

#### Inspect

### Medicine

#### Heal

#### Stims

#### Wetwork

The process of installing and uninstalling cybernetic devices is sometimes referred to as “wetwork.” Only the most skilled and daring (or foolish) wetworkers will attempt to modify their own installed wetware.

## Social

### Deceive

Pulling a fast one.

#### Bluff

#### Distract

#### Seduce

### Persuade

Changing someone’s mind.

#### Diplomacy

#### Mediate

### Command

Tell somebody what to do.

### Inspire

Encourage the committed. Grants an offensive buff.

### Intimidate

Discourage the opponent. Enemy debuff.

### Steel

Strengthen someone’s resolve. Grants a defensive buff.

## Knowledge

Unlike most skills, which are determined by a character’s stats and capabilities, the initial rank for each knowledge skill depends entirely on their Origin.

### High Life

Life among the corpos and intelligentsia

### Low Life

### Real Life
