# Initiative

To determine the order of combat, each character rolls AGI×2 against :d20:º5. Characters who succeed on the check take turns in descending order. Characters who fail the check take turns in ascending order.

> Example: A and B succeeded on their check, with a 6 and 5, respectively. A goes first, followed by B. Having failed their checks, D (3), C (4) and E (7) follow.

<!--@TODO: take 10 isn't a thing anymore-->

A success also allows a character to take :d10: for any actions or skills involving either of these stats during their first turn, instead of :d20:. A failure has no negative effects.

> Example: Francis (AGI 3, DEX 4) rolls vs. TN 7, failing with 8. Bacon (AGI 6, INT 6) rolls vs. TN 12.

## Alternative Stats

Depending on the situation (and at the discretion of the DM), characters may be able swap out one AGI stat for a different one—typically, INT, PER, or CHA. For example:

- **CHA**: sense that a conversation has taken a hostile turn before any violence occurs
- **PER**: notice something out of the ordinary
- **INT**: identify a trap moments before it's sprung

If the player and GM agree that the situation merits the application of one of these other stats, the character can roll against AGI + the second stat instead of AGI×2.
