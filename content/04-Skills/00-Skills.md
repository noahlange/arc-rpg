# Skills

In order to perform tasks of non-trivial difficulty, characters must use their Skills. Skills govern a wide variety of tasks, ranging from haggling to handling explosives. Every skill has 3 focuses, each representing a specific specialization within the purview of that skill.

Skills are ranked from 1⋅0 to 20⋅0; the initial rank for all skills are determined by a combination of a character’s base stats (DEX, AGI, CON, INT, PER and CHA) and their origin. Skills outside of a character’s origin begin between 1 and 4.

Focuses range from 0⋅0 to 10⋅0. The rank of a focus cannot exceed that of its base skill. The initial rank for every focus is 0⋅0.

Characters’ backgrounds provide an additional handful of progress points for a subset of skills. These can be distributed between the skill’s base rank and its focuses.
