# Computers

The idea of the computer as a standalone box with a screen and mouse is for most, an artifact of the past. The increasing amount of computational power available in portable packages have long since made the smartphone and its descendants—hand terminals, or handterms—the default computer for the vast majority of the population.

For the most physical machines, "home" is one of the many vast server farms making up the "cloud". Desktop machines and portable laptop computers still maintain a niche audience, almost exclusively for working professionals and those dedicated to absolute verisimilitude in the latest, hottest VR experiences.
