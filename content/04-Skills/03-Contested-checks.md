# Contested checks

Degrees of success are most relevant when comparing opposing skill checks—if both checks succeed, the roll with the higher degree of success is the winner.

There’s little point in calculating the degree if the actual values are only relevant in relation to one another—for two characters of arbitrary skill levels making a check using the same degree increment, the higher roll simply wins.

> _Example:_ Foo (Athletics 14º5) and Bar (Athletics 20º5) are arm-wrestling. Foo succeeds with 13, or +2º. Bar succeeds with 9, or +1º. Alternatively, 13 > 9: Foo wins.

For opposed skill checks operating at different degree increments, this can change:

> _Example:_ Foo shoots (Guns 16º3) at Bar, who attempts to dodge (Evade 12º5). Foo succeeds with a 10 (+3º), while Bar succeeds with a 12 (+2º). Despite Bar’s higher roll, the combination of Foo’s ability to aim and the weapon’s sheer rate of fire outstrips his ability to dodge — Bar takes a hit.

> _Example:_ Foo (Guns 16º8) shoots at Bar, who attempts to dodge (Evade 12). Foo succeeds with a 15 (+1º), while Bar succeeds with a 12 (+2º). The high recoil of Foo’s weapon prevents him from hitting Bar. Likewise, for contested rolls, taking a 1 is a bad idea.

> _Example:_ Foo (Guns 16º3) aims a burst at Bar with a submachine gun, opting to take a 1. Bar (Evade 12º5) takes an Evade reaction and succeeds with +3º. Bar manages to evade fire. Way to get complacent, Foo.

Automated hardware in good repair aren't forced to contest player rolls the same way as other characters, for whom success and failure are more subject to the vagaries of fate than simple maintenance. Most of these devices have an innate degree of success for one or more skills, usually corresponding to their effectiveness.

> A military-grade automated turret has an Aim of +3º. Any Evade check made to avoid the turret's fire requires at least +3º to succeed.

If equipment is not assigned a specific success degree, it simply defaults to +1º — in which case any successful Stealth roll will allow the character to evade detection.

> A consumer-grade surveillance camera has Awareness +1º.
