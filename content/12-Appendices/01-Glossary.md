# Glossary

## A

- **Arc**. Short for arcology, a (theoretically) self-contained megastructure. Most operate as microstates, responsible for their own law enforcement and political representation. In practice, few arcs are genuinely self-sustaining and the majority import at least some resources (often fuel, food or material goods) from the wider world.

## B

## C

- **Corp**. A corporation displaying some degree of geopolitical influence. Small corporate entities are rarely deemed "corps".
- **Corpo**. An individual working for or on behalf of a corp, either as an employee or in a less formal capacity.
- **CorpSec**. Corporate security forces, often with paramilitary equipment and training.
- **Crack**. The act of removing/disabling features viewed as undesirable by the user, often related to copy-protection or other DRM schemes.

## D

- **Dripper**. Machine capable of using chemical precursors and feedstock to execute a programmatically-defined series of controlled chemical reactions, usually with the goal of creating another chemical product.
- **Drone**. An uncrewed vehicle, often operating autonomously.

## E

- **EDA**. Exploit detection/amelioration. The process of detecting, reverse-engineering and developing countermeasures for technical vulnerabilities. Most EDA is performed by the corps whose vulnerabilities are being exploited. Occasionally, white-hack hackers will develop and distribute fixes if a corp is unwilling or unable to.
- **Exo**. A powered exoskeleton, typically composed of a strong, lightweight alloy frame and one or more mechanical muscle analogues designed to multiply the strength and power of their user.

## F

## G

## H

- **Handterm**. Hand terminal: a handheld, portable computer/communication device. A typical model is roughly the size and shape of a smartphone and before close inspection, resembles a simple piece of glass with a thin metal frame and thumb-sized notch. The glass is a self-lit OLED display; the frame and notch house the handterm’s electronic components.

## I

- **Infosec**. Individuals and teams tasked with preserving information security, responsible for maintaining ICE and EDA systems for arcs, corps, governments and militaries alike.
- **ICE**. Intrusion countermeasure electronics; security software designed to detect and counter hackers. A technical misnomer, but one with enough cultural saturation to see generic usage.

## J

## K

## L

- **Library**. A collection of source code, usually written by others, used to simplify the creation of complex or redundant functionality in software systems.
- **Librarian**. An intermediary between the developers of highly-specialized exploits and those who use them.

## M

- **MANET**. Mobile ad-hoc wireless network. A digital communication network composed of an arbitrary number of locally-connected devices.
- **Megacorp**. An unusually large corp with the _de facto_ authority to govern itself (i.e., sovereignty).
- **Milspec**. Military-specification, referring to software and hardware designed to meet or exceed specific parameters for power, security, reliability, durability and/or precision.

## N

## O

## P

- **Printer**
- **Profiler**. Small device that performs a variety of tests to determine the models and versions of equipment and pairs equipment profiles with known software and hardware exploits.

## Q

## R

- **Refiner**. Machine used to extract small amounts of high-quality feedstock from relatively large amounts of low-quality feed.
- **Root**. The superuser; a computer system’s primary administrator, or someone who has the acquired the same privileges—with or without the permission of the system’s owner.

## S

- **Scanner**.
- **SIGKILL**. The UNIX signal for immediately and unconditionally terminating a process.
- **SIGTERM**, from the UNIX signal ‘SIGTERM’, the termination of a computer process.
- **Sudo**. Short for “superuser-do”—

## T

- **Term**. A computer terminal.

## V

- **VT** (vee-tee). Derived from VTOL; an aircraft capable of performing vertical take-off and landing maneuvers.

## W

## X

## Y

## Z

**Zero-day**. An exploit or vulnerability unknown to those responsible for its mitigation, referring to the number of days the responsible organization has had to address it.
