# Basics

Arc has a small number of peculiar mechanics players should be familiar with before starting.

# Icons

A variety of icons are used throughout Arc. The shape of the icon indicates the type of thing being represented: scores and resources are surrounded by circles (e.g., :health:, :alloy:), hazards by triangles (:ballistic:, :thermal:) and item stats by cogs (:cost:, :size:). A comprehensive list of icons used in Arc, along with their meaning and usage, is presented in Appendix III.

# Dice

Both the gamemaster and each player of Arc should have access to at least one full set of polyhedral dice: :d4:, :d6:, :d8:, :d10:, :d12: and :d20:. When representing a the result of a roll (e.g., roll 2d8 for damage) standard dice notation is used. When representing a step (e.g., “ vs. ”, “roll :d20: vs. Small Guns”), the icon is used instead.

# Rank & progress

Rank & Progress (RP) scores are used to compare numbers on a small relative scale while still enabling constant, incremental progression ideal for longer campaigns.

Every RP score is composed of two numbers, a rank and a progress. When written, these are joined with a dot (•)—and in the case of a progress of 0, the latter number may be omitted entirely.

An RP score’s rank serves as its effective, in-practice value. When an RP score is invoked during regular gameplay, the score is represented as its rank.

> An object with a Size (:size:) of 3•1 has a rank and therefore effective :size: of 3.

A score’s progress point value (often referred to simply as “progress” or “points”) tracks progression from one rank to another.

> Bob's Operate skill is 14•3. He fails a skill check and gains 1 progress point. His skill increases to 14•4.

An RP score’s minimum progress value is 0. The score’s maximum progress value is equal to its current rank.

> 3⋅0 represents the lowest amount of progress from rank 3 to rank 4.3⋅3 represents the maximum amount of progress from 3 to 4.

When an RP score is at its maximum progress value and gains another point, its rank increases by 1 and its progress resets to 0. If an RP score is at its minimum value and loses another point, its rank decreases by 1 and progress is set to the value of the new rank.

> An object, including several attached doohickeys, has a material cost of 3⋅0. Removing one doohickey with a cost of (0⋅1) from the object reduces the overall material cost from 3⋅0 to 2⋅2.

Determining ranks from significant numbers of progress points (e.g., 14) can prove tedious. The table in Appendix II lists the corresponding ranks for progress points ranging from 1 to 695.

## Battlemaps

Combat in Arc is best experienced on a standard 1” battle grid.
