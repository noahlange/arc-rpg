# Phases

_Arc_ uses "phases" to track time, particularly in the context of characters’ everyday activities and their basic needs. Any given session is composed of one or more phases.

The absolute amount of time represented by the current phase depends on the scope and intensity of gameplay.

During the normal flow of exploration, conversation and downtime activities, phases are “long” and last for 4 hours, with 6 phases to each day.

> Foo and Baz are new to the city. They get a room at the flophouse and are asleep by midnight. They sleep for a couple phases, then get up in the morning. After a long phase of public transit and breakfast, they’re headed downtown. They spend another phase exploring.
>
> Foo gets a message from a contact instructing them to meet at the bar on 32nd and Oak in the evening.

During gigs and time-sensitive situations, phases are “short” and last only 10 minutes, with 6 phases to each hour.

> They reach the bar. By the end of the first short phase, they’ve read the room, checked their corners and made their way up to the bar for a drink. They spend a second phase milking the bartender for information about Foo’s friend, at which point Foo receives a text message instructing them to head outside. Foo and Baz step outside of the bar.

During combat, chases and other adrenaline-pumping situations, phases are “tense” and last 10 seconds (the length of a standard combat turn), with 6 phases for each minute.

> The GM asks that Baz make an Awareness check. He succeeds and notices a suspicious-looking figure on the other side of the street turn toward them. As the words “somethin’ fucky goin’ on” leave his lips…

## Needs

By default, _Arc_ expects that players will wish to monitor the most fundamental needs of their characters—Sleep (:sleep:) and Hunger (:hunger:)—along with their moment-to-moment health.

### When (not) to track needs

Most of the time, detailed tracking of needs adds little more than bookkeeping. So long as characters have access to a base level of financial resources and the conveniences offered by civilization, they can be expected to fill all of these needs ’behind the scenes’.

There can be any number of situations where these needs can’t be easily fulfilled. Severe time restrictions or the din of battle can make adequate rest hard to come by. When traveling outside the sprawl, steady access to food and water can become a concern. If players have no cash and no place to stay, then both sleep and hunger can prove a major challenge.

The answer to the question “is anything preventing the players from eating and/or sleeping in the next 24 hours” is “yes” or “it depends,” then track needs. If not, their needs probably aren't relevant to the story—at least for the time being.

## Sleep and rest

Every long phase is considered either **active** or **inactive**. Each inactive long phase adds 3 progress points to :sleep:; each active long phase adds 4.

Resting reduces removes 5 points from :sleep:.

Upon reaching a :sleep: of rank 5, the character is considered _sleep deprived_. Every rank of :sleep: at or above 5 reduces :speed: by 1 rank.

> Example: Bob wakes up with a :sleep: of 0•0. He spends 3 phases (12 hours) watching television and acquires 3×3=9 progress points toward :sleep:. His :sleep: is now 3•3. If he opts to spend another 2 phases (8 hours) watching television, his sleep will have increased to 5•0, at which point he should probably go to bed.

> Example: Bob wakes up with a :sleep: of 0•0. He opts to go the gym for his first phase and acquires 4 progress points toward :sleep:. By now, it's nearly mid-day: Bob spends a sedentary phase at a leisurely brunch with his friends (+3 progress points). Once Bob gets back home, however, it's business time—he spends the next phase studiously inspecting the plans for the building he intends to rob later that evening (active, +4 progress points), for a total of 4•1 :sleep:.

The ???

> Bob takes a short rest (-2 to :sleep:). He follows that up with a caffeinated beverage (-1 progress). Now with :sleep: down to 3•2, Bob finds himself refreshed and ready to take on whatever challenges 1-2 phases of burglary decide to throw his way.
>
> Unfortunately, Bob's attempted robbery did not go smoothly. After a long phase of skulking and burgling he was caught by a security guard. He spends a second phase on the run from the police, by the end of which he's gained +8 progress points of :sleep:, to a total of 4•4. Unless Bob gets a rest and/or a stimulant in the near future, he will have become sleep-deprived by the end of the current phase, which would reduce his available :speed: by 1 rank. Should Bob end up in a fight-or-flight situation, this could be a major disadvantage.

A full rest is required to reset the 4 phase counter and restore :speed: to full.

The use of a chemical stimulant or taking a short rest resets the 1 phase deprivation counter; it’ll restart at the beginning of the next long phase.

|           |                    |
| :-------- | ------------------ |
| Sedentary | +3 :sleep: / phase |
| Active    | +4 :sleep: / phase |
| Resting   | -5 :sleep: / phase |
